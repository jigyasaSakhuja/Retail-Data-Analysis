Predicting the product level sales
An important goal in retail is to be able to forecast article demand as this enables us to plan our business. This can be done using a basic model that considers the average demand over some weeks in the past. But your product owner wants to know if something better can be done. So she contacts the data engineer who gladly provides a dataset. Now it's your turn to show her what is possible with more advanced models! 


The Data Set

The data given consists of weekly sales data for 25 articles in the category of "Processed Foods" for a certain country for approximately two years. The problem is to create a demand forecaster for this category that predicts article-level demand one week in advance. That is, given the features of the current week, the model is able to predict the number of units sold in the following week. You may assume that the unit price, the unit discount and the low stock warning are known for the following week in the current week itself.
